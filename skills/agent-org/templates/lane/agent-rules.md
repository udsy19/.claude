# Rules for every worker agent (read before your brief)

You are a Claude Code agent directed by the supervisor of lane `{{LANE}}`. Read `{{LANE_ROOT}}/context.md`
first: the product, the owner's rulings and what has NOT worked.

- **HEADLESS.** Your process exits the moment you end your turn. Run every command in the FOREGROUND and
  wait for it. Never use run_in_background or Monitor, and never end your turn "to wait". Write your report
  before you stop.
- **VAULT FIRST (mandatory).** Before you design or build, search the vault for what is already known about
  your goal. Start at `vault/AGENTS.md` (routing), `vault/Index.md` (decided, measured, tried, rejected) and
  `vault/Map-code.md`, then the relevant `Design/`, `Research/`, `Reports/`, `Decisions/` and `Sessions/`
  notes.
  - Your report OPENS with a **Vault check**: notes read (paths), what was already known, what you reused,
    and what is wrong or stale.
  - Before you finish, write your durable findings back: measured findings to `vault/Reports/`, findings
    about the outside world (cited) to `vault/Research/`. Where each kind of finding goes:
    `vault/Design/lanes-and-supervisors.md` § Where research findings go.
  - **Never edit or commit the generated files**: the folder hubs (`vault/**/README.md`), `vault/Map.md`
    and `vault/Index.md` (its PROMOTED block is the overseer's). The loop regenerates the hubs after every
    MERGE and LAND; branches that commit their own hub output only conflict with each other. Run
    `node scripts/vault-hubs.mjs --check` if you want to see that your note will be linked.
  - Before writing any new symbol: `vault/Index.md`, then `node scripts/where.mjs <name> --branches`,
    then `git grep` (`.claude/rules/no-bloat.md`). Delete what your change supersedes.
  - Rebuilding what the vault records as built, tried or rejected, without saying why, is a failed task.
- **GOAL, not tests.** Derive the checks you need from your goal. Prove results through the REAL product
  (screenshots, drawings, short videos; your own port, never a shared one). Never weaken or delete a test.
  If a test is wrong, prove it and replace it.
- **Your worktree and branch are your own.** Commit small and often, and end messages with the project's
  attribution trailer.
  - Never push or merge to main yourself.
  - Never force-push.
  - Never run `git config` against the shared repo (all worktrees share one `.git/config`).
  - Tests that commit must use a throw-away repo.
  - Do not edit protected paths (`vault/Plan.md`, `vault/Roadmap.md`, `vault/Decisions/`,
    `.claude/rules/`); a hook refuses it and a landing gate re-checks it. To change one, file
    `node scripts/propose.mjs --row <id> --kind … --why "…"` and say so in your report.
  - No auto-memory: no `memory:` frontmatter, no `.claude/agent-memory/` (per-branch copies conflict).
- **Builds.** Use your own build dir (already set in your env). Heavy builds go through the machine-wide
  queue (it is on your PATH). Build only what you need.
- **Sub-agents.** You may launch your own sub-agents (the Agent tool) for parallel research, review or
  exploration. Give each a goal-framed brief, and merge their findings into YOUR report. You are
  accountable for them. Their only channel is the Agent tool's prompt and return value; they do not
  write the vault. If your Claude Code version does not allow a sub-agent to spawn further agents, do
  all the fan-out yourself.
- **Images the supervisor should see** go in `{{LANE_ROOT}}/renders/<your agent name>/` (PNG, descriptive
  names). It sees only images newer than its last consult (at most 12, shared with the owner's reference
  images in `renders/owner/`), so write the ones that matter last and don't re-save old ones.
- **Never print or commit secrets.**
- **CHECKPOINT REPORT.** You have a fixed time budget. Write your report file within the first hour, then
  update it at least every 2 hours. Each update covers state, commits, evidence and next. The final version
  replaces it. Never let more than 2 hours of findings exist only in your head.
- **REPORT** (to the path at the end of your brief). The supervisor sees its `## TL;DR`, its first ~2k
  characters and its last ~3k, so the shape matters:
  - `## TL;DR` FIRST, at most 10 lines: outcome, evidence paths, what you recommend;
  - Vault check;
  - what you found;
  - what you changed (commits);
  - evidence paths;
  - what you did NOT do or could not verify;
  - what the supervisor should do next (LAST, so it is in the tail the supervisor reads).
